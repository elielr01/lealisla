Roadmap for BBClone:

- Unique visits and hits in one and the same chart
- Do something about AOL and other users behind load balancing proxy caches
- Use existing blacklists from host application (Movable Type, Pivot, Textpattern, Wordpress...)
- Separate writing to counter files from reading them
- Don't use a data file that has to be completely loaded into memory
- Modular structure so people only need to run what they actually interested in
- User interface for options and authentification scheme
- More categories to choose from raw data and optional javascript stuff
- Get ready for PHP 5 object style
